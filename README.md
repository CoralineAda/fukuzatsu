# Fukuzatsu

Fukuzatsu ("complexity") is a tool for measuring code complexity in Ruby class files. Its analysis
generates scores based on cyclomatic complexity algorithms, which in simplest terms measure the number of execution paths through a given piece of code. (You can learn more about cyclomatic complexity [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity).)

Why should you care about this kind of complexity? More complex code tends to attract bugs and to
increase the friction around extending features or refactoring code.

Fukuzatsu was created by [Coraline Ada Ehmke](http://where.coraline.codes/) and is maintained by [Coraline Ada Ehmke](http://where.coraline.codes/), [Mike Ziwisky](https://github.com/mziwisky), and the team at [Instructure](http://www.instructure.com/). It was originally inspired by Saikuro, written by Zev Blut.

## Installation

Install the gem:

    $ gem install fukuzatsu

This installs the CLI tool.

## Usage

    fuku check path/to/file/my_file.rb

    fuku check path/to/file/my_file.rb -f html
    # Writes to doc/fuzuzatsu/htm/index.htm

    fuku check path/to/file/my_file.rb -f csv
    # Writes to doc/fuzuzatsu/csv/results.csv

    fuku check path/to/file/my_file.rb -f json
    # Writes to doc/fuzuzatsu/json/results.json
